# Tumblr-cpp
Tumblr API library written in C++.

## Requirements

* C++ 17
* CMake 3.5

Any version greater than these listed will suffice.

### Dependencies

* [RapidJSON](https://github.com/tencent/rapidjson)
* [cpr](https://github.com/whoshuu/cpr)
* [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/tree/v2.x) (Only for unit tests - not used in the actual library)

## Usage

This library is still a major work in progress - 
so for now use at your own discretion as there is very little documentation and testing is essentially non-existent.

Once the first major release gets published this section will be updated to include how to implement and use in your own projects, 
and include other examples.

## Contributing

Don't (for now at least).
